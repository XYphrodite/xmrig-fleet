/// <summary>
/// A tested hypothesis that turned out to be wrong. It is kept so nobody tries it again, and
/// this comment exists to stop the code being read as a remedy - which it is not.
///
/// The problem it was meant to solve: an i7-12700KF mines RandomX at 4,380 H/s with nothing
/// watching and 7,092 H/s with Task Manager open, and 7,097 with Resource Monitor. The two
/// monitors agreeing to within a tenth of a percent said the effect belonged to something they
/// share rather than to either application, and the obvious shared thing is that both poll the
/// performance-counter subsystem continuously. So: let the agent poll the same counters and the
/// window becomes unnecessary.
///
/// It does not. Polling them from here changes the hashrate by nothing measurable. Whatever
/// Windows does differently, it is not "somebody is reading these counters" - or not only that,
/// because a service in session 0 reading them is evidently not the same as a window in the
/// logged-on session reading them. That is why <see cref="SessionMonitorService"/> still keeps a
/// real Task Manager open, and why it says in its own comments that it is a remedy without a
/// diagnosis.
///
/// This was the ninth of eleven explanations tried and discarded, each by a controlled A/B on
/// that node. The others: huge pages (constant at 1180/1180 throughout), free memory (20 GB
/// spare either way), CPU frequency, competing processes (nothing above 0.5%), xmrig's own
/// priority (worth +26% on its own, not this), the High Performance power plan, a 1 ms timer
/// resolution, opting the process out of EcoQoS, Win32PrioritySeparation, and simply having a
/// window open - a visible Notepad changes nothing.
///
/// Left in the build rather than deleted because a negative result is worth keeping where the
/// next person will look for it, and because polling three counters once a second costs nothing
/// worth measuring. Switch it off with Agent:PollPerformanceCounters if that judgement is wrong.
///
/// Counters are added by their English names through PdhAddEnglishCounter: the localised path a
/// tool like typeperf expects fails outright on a non-English Windows, which is how this was
/// first noticed.
