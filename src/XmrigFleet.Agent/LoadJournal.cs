/// The point of this class is that it runs whether or not throttling is switched on. Until now the
/// only record a node kept of its own load was the throttle's list of rung changes, so a machine
/// with throttling off - which is the shipped default - wrote nothing at all, and the one question
/// an operator actually asks afterwards ("what was this thing doing when it felt slow?") had no
/// answer anywhere. The diagnostic was locked behind the remedy.
///
/// A minute is the bucket because a second is too many lines to keep and an hour hides the thing
/// worth seeing. Both the average and the peak are kept for the same reason: a download that
/// stutters is a burst, and an average over sixty seconds flattens exactly the spike that caused
/// the complaint.
///
/// Pure and clock-injected, like <see cref="ThrottleLadder"/> and <see cref="GpuPauseRule"/>, so
/// the boundary behaviour can be tested without waiting a minute for it.
