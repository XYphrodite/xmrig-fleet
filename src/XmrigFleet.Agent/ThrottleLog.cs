/// The node's own record of what its CPU was doing and what the throttle did about it, in
/// throttle.log beside the agent. Two kinds of line, interleaved in time on purpose: a rung
/// change when one happens, and one summary line a minute always.
///
/// The thresholds shipped with this feature are a guess. Tuning them from how the machine felt is
/// how we spent a day chasing a hashrate effect that eleven guesses could not explain, and the
/// only thing that moved it was a log of numbers. So the log carries the inputs, not just the
/// outcome: a week of it should say plainly which rung fired for nothing.
///
/// The per-minute line is written whether or not throttling is switched on, which is the whole
/// point of it. Throttling ships off, so until now a node kept no record of its own load at all,
/// and "the machine felt slow an hour ago" could only ever be answered by guessing.
///
/// Bounded the same way <see cref="FileLogger"/> is - a node runs unattended for months, and no
/// diagnostic is worth filling its disk. Four megabytes at roughly 150 KB a day is about a month,
/// and the rotation keeps the month before that.
