/// Why this and not fewer mining threads: changing the thread count means rewriting xmrig's
/// config and restarting its backend, which re-allocates the RandomX dataset. On a node whose
/// memory is already tight that hand-back can fail, and a miner that loses its huge pages runs
/// several times slower with nothing to show for it - measured at 4.5x on the Xeon. A job object
/// caps the same process instantly, leaves the dataset and the huge pages exactly where they are,
/// and the scale it takes is already 0-100.
///
/// The cap is a share of the whole machine, not of one core, which is what makes it mean the same
/// thing on a 6-thread node and a 28-thread one.
///
/// Surviving an agent restart takes some care. A process cannot be removed from a job object, and
/// nested jobs combine by taking the *most* restrictive limit - so an agent that forgot its job
/// and created a second one could lower the cap but never raise it, and a node left at 25% could
/// not be brought back to full speed without killing the miner. The job is therefore named, and a
/// restarted agent re-opens the one it made last time.
