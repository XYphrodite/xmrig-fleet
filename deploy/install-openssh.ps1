<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs and starts the built-in Windows OpenSSH server on a mining node, reachable
    from the tailnet only.

.DESCRIPTION
    Nodes are diagnosed by hand far more often than the fleet API allows: the agent
    exposes miner control and telemetry, not a shell, so a node with no SSH server can
    only be inspected by sitting at it. This script turns on the OpenSSH server that
    ships with Windows 10/11 as an optional feature, registers it to start with the
    machine, and opens port 22 to 100.64.0.0/10 the way install-agent.ps1 opens 47800 -
    the tailnet is the security boundary, so the port must never face the LAN.

    That component is a Feature on Demand, fetched from Windows Update rather than from the
    installation media, and on a node whose updates are pointed at a WSUS server that does
    not carry it the install fails with REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG after a long silent wait. Seen
    on a live node. When that happens the script falls back to the upstream MSI, which needs
    nothing from Windows Update - see Install-FromRelease for why that is a fallback and not
    the default.

    Authentication is by public key. A password-authenticated SSH server on a mining rig
    is an invitation, and the operator console already reaches these nodes without one.
    Pass -PublicKey (or set $env:XMRIG_FLEET_SSH_KEY) and the key is installed for
    -UserName. Which file that means is decided by whether the account is an
    administrator: Windows' sshd_config sends every admin login to one shared
    administrators_authorized_keys and ignores that account's own ~\.ssh, so a key
    written to the wrong one of the two is silently never read.

    Run this in an elevated PowerShell on the node. It can also be run straight from the
    web, which avoids the execution policy that blocks a downloaded .ps1 file:

        $env:XMRIG_FLEET_SSH_KEY  = 'ssh-ed25519 AAAA... operator'
        $env:XMRIG_FLEET_SSH_USER = 'local'
        irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XYphrodite/xmrig-fleet/master/deploy/install-openssh.ps1 | iex

    That URL is cached for five minutes, so a node re-run straight after a push can be handed
    the previous copy. Check the version this prints against $ScriptVersion below; when they
    differ, fetch the commit instead of the branch:

        .../xmrig-fleet/<commit sha>/deploy/install-openssh.ps1

    Nothing here touches xmrig or the fleet agent: installing SSH does not interrupt
    mining.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs OpenSSH from the upstream release when the Windows component will not.

.DESCRIPTION
    Deliberately a fallback rather than the default. The component that ships with Windows
    is serviced by Windows Update; a copy installed from a release is not, and somebody has
    to remember it exists. But a node that cannot install the component is a node that can
    only ever be diagnosed by sitting at it, which is the very thing this script exists to
    avoid, so the fallback wins over having no shell at all.

    Upstream tags every build "Preview" - it is their long-standing habit, not a warning
    about this particular one - so a release is chosen by date and that label is ignored.

.SYNOPSIS
    Installs a Windows capability, giving up rather than hanging, and falling back to the MSI.

.DESCRIPTION
    Add-WindowsCapability offers no timeout of its own, and on a node that cannot reach a
    source it sits on a progress bar for a long time before admitting defeat - an operator
    watched it twice. Run as a job so there is something to abandon.

    Abandoning a running DISM operation is not free: the component store can be left with
    work pending, which a later "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" clears. That is
    said out loud rather than hidden, and it is still better than a script that never returns.
